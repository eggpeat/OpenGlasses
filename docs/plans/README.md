# OpenGlasses Feature Plans

This is the canonical home for all OpenGlasses feature plans. Plans are lettered in creation order:
**A–Z**, then **AA, AB, AC…** as the alphabet runs out. Each row links to the full plan doc; the
detailed status, scope, and open questions live there. House style: a deterministic, headless-testable
core first, with the live/device/backend edge deferred; one PR per plan.

**Legend:** ✅ Shipped · 🚧 Core shipped / partial (live or follow-up edge deferred) · 📋 Planned · 📝 Drafted (not scheduled)

| [AZ](vehicle-ev-status.md) | Vehicle / EV Status Tool | ✅ v1 shipped — `vehicle` tool over the Home Assistant path |

**Three selectable expert-stream transports** (Plans L/M + the meeting-link connector): **MJPEG** (same-LAN browser viewer), **Meeting link** (zero-infra — your meeting tool hosts the call; recommended for remote, nothing to self-host), and **WebRTC** (self-hosted peer-to-peer, needs your own signaling + TURN).

**Genuinely outstanding** (cannot be done/tested without hardware or hosting): the self-hosted WebRTC path only — deploy the signaling relay + TURN, host the expert web client, run on-device echo/precedence testing. The Meeting-link transport needs none of this.

## How the plans were grouped (rounds)

The lettering above is creation order; the plans were drafted in themed rounds. The detail (effort,
what each reuses, strategic fit) lives in the individual plan docs — this section is just the map and
the suggested sequences.

- **Round 1 — foundation (A–F).** Accessibility tier, Health Vault, Live Coach, Utilities, MCP server, and the B2B **Field Assist** engine. Sequence: D → A2 → A1 → F Phase 1 → B → F Phase 2 → A3 → F Phases 3–5.
- **Round 2 — features unlocked by the shipped engines (G–M).** Reuse VaultStore/ProcedureRunner, `analyzeFrame`, the assistive loop, OCR, the ExpertBridge seam, OneEuroFilter — mostly content/wiring. Adds the IT pack, custom vault import, medication ID, low-vision nav, integration polish, and the WebRTC expert path.
- **Round 3 — agent control (N).** Glasses as a hands-free remote for any coding/agent backend.
- **Round 4 — on-device knowledge (O–Q).** Document RAG + citations + vault/skills-library management.
- **Round 5 — agentic hardening, MCP safety & field workflows (R–W).** Sequence: R (safety first) → S (agentic spine) → T (offline) → U (capture schema) → V + W (catalogue + throttle). A work-order/dispatch model is deferred until T/U land.
- **Round 6 — interactive display (X–Y).** Read-only HUD → interactive, driven by the Neural Band over `MWDATDisplay`. Sequence: X first (validates band nav on one card), then Y (the launcher reuses X's router).
- **Round 7 — additional capabilities (AJ).** Self-contained features over the shipped engines; the phone-side `MWDATDisplay` renderer shipped as `HUDPreviewView`.
- **Round 8 — standalone phone app & on-device creation (AK–AN).** Daily-driver app with glasses off: chat front door, image generation, embedding upgrade, scoped Projects. Sequence: Chat → Projects → Embedding → Image gen (independent).
- **Round 9 — reliability & connectivity hardening (AO–AS).** Audio-session resilience (P1/P2 + lease coordinator), speaker diarization, gateway device pairing. Shipped in order #114 → #115 → #116.
- **Round 10 — live-vision efficiency & self-improvement (AT–AW).** Sequence: Frame Gate → Cost Tracker → Visual State Memory → Skill Self-Evolution (largest, safety-sensitive; sequence last).
- **Round 11 — adaptive long-term memory (AX).** A typed memory layer over the existing stores; re-scoped after a code audit to the real gaps (project-scoped memory + relevance retrofit). Pairs with the Embedding Upgrade (AM) and Visual State Memory (AV).
- **Standalone tools.** First-Aid (AA), HECA (AC), Structured Vision (AD), Study Mode (AE), Memory/Recall (AY), Vehicle (AZ), and the planned/drafted items (AB, AF, AG, AH, AI) sit outside a single round but are indexed and lettered above.

## Dependency graph

```
Plan F (Phase 1: VaultStore foundation)
   │
   ├──> Plan B (Health Vault — first applied vault)
   ├──> Plan F (Refrigeration pack — first vertical)
   └──> Plan F (additional vertical packs)
```

Plans A, C, D, E are independent and can ship in any order. The on-device knowledge/memory line
(O → P → AY → AX) and the embedding upgrade (AM) reinforce each other: AM sharpens retrieval for O/P
(RAG), AX (memory relevance), and AW (skill retrieval).

## Revenue impact, rough

| Plan | Revenue model | Order of magnitude |
|---|---|---|
| A | Accessibility IAP (consumer) | $–$$ |
| B / AB / AC | Bundled with / extends Medical Compliance IAP | (uplift) |
| C / D / E | Free | — |
| **F (+ G, H)** | **B2B subscription, per-seat** | **$$$–$$$$** |

Plan F is the single largest revenue opportunity. Even one signed refrigeration contractor
(~20 techs × $200/mo) is ~$48k/yr in recurring revenue without consumer marketing spend.

## Cross-cutting infrastructure

Generic `VaultStore` (built in Plan F Phase 1) is the shared foundation for all domain knowledge bases:

| Vault | Plan | Gating |
|---|---|---|
| `health` | B | Medical Compliance IAP |
| `refrigeration` | F MVP | Field Assist – Refrigeration IAP |
| `it_network` | G | Field Assist – IT IAP |
| `electrical` | F v2 | Field Assist – Electrical IAP |
| `automotive` | F v2 | Field Assist – Auto IAP |
| `custom` | H | Enterprise tier |
